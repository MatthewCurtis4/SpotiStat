SpotiStat

SpotiStat is an easy to use website that allows anyone to find there top listened to artists and songs on Spotify!

Unfortunely, due to changes and restrictions added by Spotify to there Development program, SpotiStat is currently not publically available and there needs
to be some changes made in order to publish it again.

I have attached the link to where the website is hosted but your data will not appear.

As a result, I will add some photos here to provide a preview of the site.

Project Website can be accessed [here](https://spoti-stat-v1.vercel.app/)
